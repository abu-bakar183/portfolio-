# C# Projects

These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework.

## Projects:

* [Car Insurance](#car-insurance)
* [NFL Stats](#nfl-stats)

## Car Insurance

This project is an ASP.NET MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

**Technologies Used:**
* ASP.NET MVC 5
* Entity Framework 6
* SQL Server
* ASP.NET Identity for authentication

**Usage:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Update the database connection string in `Web.config`.
4. Run the application.

## NFL Stats

This is a data visualization application that is meant to store and display football stats for the purposes of fantasy football. It is an ASP.NET MVC web application that utilizes Entity Framework 6 for data access and a Code First workflow. It is still a work in progress.

**Technologies Used:**
* ASP.NET MVC 5
* Entity Framework 6
* SQL Server
* Chart.js for data visualization
* (Potentially) Sports data APIs

**Work in Progress:**
* Implementing data fetching from external APIs.
* Enhancing data visualization with more interactive charts.
* Adding user authentication and profile management.
